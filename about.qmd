I am a fourth-year student at the University of Toronto. I am interested in applying quantitative methods to answer biological questions. My interests have motivated me to learn a blend of theory and application across biology, mathematics, and statistics.

Outside of school I enjoy reading and writing, listening to music and playing the piano, and watching movies.
